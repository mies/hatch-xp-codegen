  "specContent": "# GitHub Pull Request Syntax Review Bot\n\nThis document outlines the detailed implementation plan for a GitHub pull request review bot that focuses on checking for TypeScript syntax errors. The bot will be triggered automatically whenever a pull request is created or updated on GitHub, and it will report any syntax errors as comments directly on the pull request.\n\n## 1. Technology Stack\n\n- **Edge Runtime:** Cloudflare Workers\n- **API Framework:** Hono.js (TypeScript-based API framework)\n- **Version Control & Webhook Source:** GitHub\n- **Languages Analyzed:** TypeScript\n- **Syntax Checking:** TypeScript Compiler API (using native functions or ts.transpileModule)\n\n## 2. High-Level Architecture & Workflow\n\n1. **Webhook Listener:**\n   - Deploy a Cloudflare Worker with Hono.js to serve as a webhook endpoint. This endpoint will be registered in GitHub to receive pull request events (creation and updates).\n\n2. **Authentication & Security:**\n   - Validate incoming webhook requests using a secret token (configured in GitHub and stored as an environment variable in Cloudflare Workers).\n   - Use a GitHub token (stored securely in the environment) to authenticate API calls to GitHub when posting comments.\n\n3. **Processing a PR Event:**\n   - On receiving a pull request event, extract the PR details from the payload.\n   - Identify the files changed in the PR that have the `.ts` extension.\n   - For each TypeScript file, fetch the file content from the repository using the GitHub API.\n\n4. **Syntax Checking:**\n   - Use the TypeScript compiler API to perform syntax checking. A lightweight approach is to use `ts.transpileModule` which can return syntax diagnostics without performing a full type-checking pass.\n   - Collate any syntax errors detected for each file.\n\n5. **Review Comment Posting:**\n   - If syntax errors are found, format them into a clear, concise comment. The comment should include:\n     - The file name\n     - The specific syntax error(s) reported\n   - Post the comment directly to the pull request using the GitHub API.\n\n## 3. API Endpoints\n\nThe service will expose one primary endpoint to handle webhook events from GitHub:\n\n### 3.1. POST /webhook\n\n- **Description:** Receives and validates pull request events from GitHub\n- **Authentication:** Verify the webhook token sent in headers or payload\n- **Processing Flow:** \n  1. Validate the webhook signature/token\n  2. Check if the event is a PR creation/update\n  3. For each changed file ending with `.ts`:\n     - Fetch file contents from GitHub via API\n     - Run syntax check using TypeScript compiler\n  4. If any file fails the syntax check, construct a comment detailing the errors\n  5. Use the GitHub API (authenticated via a GitHub token) to post a comment on the PR\n- **Expected Payload Example:** (refer to GitHub webhook payload for pull_request events)\n\n## 4. Database Schema\n\nNo relational database is needed since the botâ€™s functionality is primarily stateless -- processing webhook events and interacting with GitHub APIs. All required state (like tokens and secrets) will be stored as environment variables.\n\n## 5. Integrations\n\n- **GitHub Webhooks:** For triggering the bot on pull request events\n- **GitHub API:** Post comments using a valid GitHub token\n- **TypeScript Compiler API:** To check file syntax in-memory\n\n## 6. Environment Variables & Secret Management\n\nMake sure to configure and manage the following environment variables securely:\n\n- WEBHOOK_SECRET: Secret token to validate incoming webhook requests\n- GITHUB_TOKEN: Token for authentication when making GitHub API calls to fetch file content and post comments\n- (Optional) Other configuration parameters as needed\n\n## 7. Future Considerations\n\n- **Enhanced Analysis:** In the future, consider extending the bot to perform more advanced checks (e.g., style linting, type-checking, etc.)\n- **Language Support:** Expand support to additional programming languages.\n- **Configuration per Repository:** Allow repositories to customize the syntax checking rules or enable/disable the bot dynamically.\n- **Rate-Limiting and Backoff:** Implement rate-limiting on posting comments to handle large pull requests gracefully.\n- **Testing & Logging:** Augment the bot with extensive logging and testing, either by unit tests or integration tests within the Cloudflare Workers environment.\n\n## 8. Deployment Notes\n\n- Use Cloudflare Workers for deployment on the edge.\n- Prior to deployment, thoroughly test webhook verification and GitHub API integrations locally or in a staging environment.\n- Monitor logs after deployment to ensure events are processed correctly.\n\n## 9.
