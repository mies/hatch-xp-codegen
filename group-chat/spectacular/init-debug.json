  "specName": "GroupChat Edge Application",
  "specContent": "# GroupChat Edge Application Specification\n\nThis document outlines the implementation plan for a group chat application that supports chat groups of two or more people. The application leverages an invitation system for group joining and uses third-party social authentication along with email-based invitations. Messages within groups are ephemeral and will be deleted automatically 24 hours after creation.\n\n## 1. Technology Stack\n\n- **Edge Runtime:** Cloudflare Workers\n- **API Framework:** Hono.js (TypeScript)\n- **Database:** Cloudflare D1 (SQLite edge database) with Drizzle ORM as the type-safe SQL query builder\n- **Authentication:** Clerk (leveraging third-party social authentication providers)\n- **Email Integration:** Resend (for sending group invitations)\n- **Job Scheduling / Message Cleanup:** Cloudflare Workers scheduled events (cron triggers) for deleting expired messages\n\n## 2. Database Schema Design\n\nThe system requires managing users, groups, group memberships, messages, and invitation tokens. Below is an outline of the tables and their relationship.\n\n### 2.1. Users Table\n\n- id (INTEGER, Primary Key, Auto Increment)\n- clerkId (STRING, unique identifier provided by Clerk)\n- email (STRING, unique)\n- name (STRING)\n- profilePhotoUrl (STRING)  // URL for the user's profile photo\n- createdAt (DATETIME)\n\n### 2.2. Groups Table\n\n- id (INTEGER, Primary Key, Auto Increment)\n- name (STRING)  // Group name\n- ownerId (INTEGER)  // reference to the Users table indicating the creator/owner\n- createdAt (DATETIME)\n\n### 2.3. GroupMembers Table\n\n- id (INTEGER, Primary Key, Auto Increment)\n- groupId (INTEGER, foreign key to Groups id)\n- userId (INTEGER, foreign key to Users id)\n- joinedAt (DATETIME)\n\n### 2.4. Invitations Table\n\nThis table manages pending invitations so users can join groups via email link.\n\n- id (INTEGER, Primary Key, Auto Increment)\n- groupId (INTEGER, foreign key to Groups id)\n- email (STRING)  // the email address the invitation was sent to\n- token (STRING, unique)  // secure token for accepting the invitation\n- status (STRING, e.g., 'pending', 'accepted', 'expired')\n- createdAt (DATETIME)\n- expiresAt (DATETIME)  // time after which the invitation is no longer valid\n\n### 2.5. Messages Table\n\n- id (INTEGER, Primary Key, Auto Increment)\n- groupId (INTEGER, foreign key to Groups id)\n- senderId (INTEGER, foreign key to Users id)\n- content (TEXT)  // the body of the message\n- createdAt (DATETIME)  // timestamp of the message\n\nNote: A scheduled worker will periodically execute a cleanup job to delete messages whose createdAt timestamp is older than 24 hours.\n\n## 3. API Endpoints\n\nThe API endpoints will be grouped into categories based on functionality, such as groups, invitations, and messaging.\n\n### 3.1. Group Endpoints\n\n- **POST /groups**\n  - Description: Create a new group chat. The authenticated user becomes the group owner and an initial member.\n  - Expected Payload:\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Group Name\"\n    }\n\n- **GET /groups**\n  - Description: Retrieve a list of groups the authenticated user is a member of.\n\n- **GET /groups/:groupId**\n  - Description: Retrieve details for a specific group, including list of group members.\n\n### 3.2. Invitation Endpoints\n\n- **POST /groups/:groupId/invite**\n  - Description: Send an invitation to an email address to join a specific group. This endpoint creates an invitation record with a secure token and triggers an email via Resend.\n  - Expected Payload:\n    {\n      \"email\": \"invitee@example.com\"\n    }\n\n- **POST /invitations/accept**\n  - Description: Accept an invitation using a token provided in the email link. On acceptance, the user is added to the group; update the invitation status to 'accepted'.\n  - Expected Payload:\n    {\n      \"token\": \"secure-invite-token\"\n    }\n\n### 3.3. Messaging Endpoints\n\n- **POST /groups/:groupId/messages**\n  - Description: Post a new message to a group. The endpoint will verify the sender's membership in the group.\n  - Expected Payload:\n    {\n      \"content\": \"Message content text\"\n    }\n\n- **GET /groups/:groupId/messages**\n  - Description: Retrieve messages for a group. Only messages from the last 24 hours should be returned.\n  - Query Params (optional): May include pagination or a timestamp filter if needed\n\n## 4. Additional Integrations\n\n- Clerk for handling third-party social authentication. This service manages login, session management, and user identification.\n- Resend for email notifications to send out group invitation emails. The invitation email should contain a link that includes the invitation token.\n- Cloudflare Workers scheduled triggers to clean up old messages (every hour or as needed), ensuring messages older than 24 hours are purged.\n\n## 5. Additional Notes\n\n- Authentication and authorization should be enforced for all endpoints. The system should confirm that the authenticated user is a member of a group before allowing access to group-specific endpoints.\n- Better error handling and logging to be considered during implementation.\n- Ensure secure generation and validation of invitation tokens to prevent unauthorized access to groups.\n- Use environment variables or secrets for configuration details such as API keys for Clerk and Resend.\n\n## 6. Future Considerations\n\n- Real-time functionality: Consider utilizing Cloudflare Durable Objects or WebSocket alternatives for real-time group chat updates.\n- Enhanced message retention strategies: Allow configurable message retention policies or archiving messages for groups who may want persistence beyond 24 hours.\n- User profile enhancements: Allow users to update their profile photos and other information.\n- Group management features: Additional endpoints for group admins to remove users or change group settings.\n- Rate limiting and security enhancements to avoid abuse.\n\n## 7. Further Reading\n\n- Cloudflare Workers documentation\n- Hono.js documentation\n- Cloudflare D1 & Drizzle ORM documentation\n- Clerk documentation for third-party authentication\n- Resend documentation for email integrations\n\nThis implementation plan provides the necessary high-level guidance and architectural considerations needed to develop the GroupChat Edge Application using the HONC stack.",
